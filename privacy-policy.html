  </p>
  <p>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
    information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not
    possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
    backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
    isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

  10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
</p>
<p>
  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
  include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to
  signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
  activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
  recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
  not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
  automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
  standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
  we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
  notice.
